A script to format code in specified folders/files using Phpstorms formatting tool

Installation:

Clone this repo into the folder where you keep all of your dev projects

Define your Phpstorm's main bin folder (where phpstorm.sh is located) in the config file
Define your project folder in the config file

Specify the folders or files you want to format in the "directories" file 

The default config values are based off my box so they should pretty much be the same for everyone

Use:

cd into the root (this current folder)

Run the script by entering "bash format_files.sh" or "./format_files.sh" in your terminal

(the script will modify the format.properties file so git will think it was changed by you, just ignore this)

Done! now all of the specified directories/files should be formatted according to the style found in "format/team_format.xml"

Updating:

To update the formatter just run the main "format_files" script and it will auto update for you
You can also run "git pull" to get the latest changes
